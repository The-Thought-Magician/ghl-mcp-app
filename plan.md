# Project Plan: GoHighLevel MCP Server

This document outlines the plan for developing a Multi-Channel Platform (MCP) server using the `fastmcp` library in Python, which will interact with the GoHighLevel API. The server will dynamically generate its API tools based on the official GoHighLevel API documentation, ensuring up-to-date functionality.

## Project Goals
- Develop an MCP server using `fastmcp`.
- Integrate GoHighLevel API endpoints as `fastmcp` tools.
- Implement authentication using a private integration key.
- Ensure tools are automatically updated when the GoHighLevel API documentation changes.
- Use `uv` for virtual environment management.

## Phases and Tasks

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Documentation Acquisition âœ… COMPLETED

**Goal:** Establish the basic project structure, set up the Python environment, and acquire the GoHighLevel API documentation.

- **Task 1.1: Create `uv` virtual environment.** âœ… COMPLETED
  - Command: `uv venv`
- **Task 1.2: Activate virtual environment.** âœ… COMPLETED
  - Command: `source .venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- **Task 1.3: Install `fastmcp` and `uv` (if not already installed globally).** âœ… COMPLETED
  - Command: `uv pip install fastmcp aiohttp pydantic python-dotenv`
- **Task 1.4: Clone GoHighLevel API documentation repository.** âœ… COMPLETED
  - Repository: `https://github.com/GoHighLevel/highlevel-api-docs.git`
  - Target directory: `docs/`
  - Command: `git clone https://github.com/GoHighLevel/highlevel-api-docs.git docs/`
- **Task 1.5: Create `plan.md` (this file) and `README.md` files.** âœ… COMPLETED
  - Status: Both files created and comprehensive documentation provided.
- **Task 1.6: Initial commit: "Phase 1: Project setup and documentation acquisition complete."** âœ… COMPLETED

### Phase 2: Documentation Parsing and Model Generation âœ… COMPLETED

**Goal:** Develop a mechanism to parse the GoHighLevel API documentation and automatically generate `fastmcp`-compatible tool definitions.

**NOTE:** This phase was revolutionized by using FastMCP's native OpenAPI integration instead of custom parsing.

**IMPORTANT:** The original approach of generating static Python files was replaced with FastMCP's dynamic tool generation. This provides:
- Real-time tool generation at server startup
- Automatic handling of OpenAPI schema validation
- Better performance and reliability
- No need to maintain generated code files

- **Task 2.1: Analyze GoHighLevel API documentation structure.** âœ… COMPLETED
  - Identified 32 OpenAPI JSON specifications covering 223+ API endpoints.
  - Discovered schema validation issues that needed fixing.
- **Task 2.2: Write a Python script (`scripts/generate_tools.py`) for documentation parsing.** âœ… COMPLETED (Legacy)
  - Created for reference, but replaced by FastMCP's native OpenAPI support.
- **Task 2.3: Generate `fastmcp`-compatible tool definitions.** âœ… COMPLETED
  - Used `FastMCP.from_openapi()` for automatic tool generation from merged OpenAPI specs.
  - Implemented schema fixing for GoHighLevel's non-standard OpenAPI elements.
  - Generated 327 routes from 223 API endpoints.
- **Task 2.4: Integrate the generation script into the project.** âœ… COMPLETED
  - Integrated directly into main server (`src/main.py`) using FastMCP's OpenAPI parser.
- **Task 2.5: Run the generation script to create initial tool files.** âœ… COMPLETED
  - Tools are generated dynamically at server startup.
- **Task 2.6: Commit: "Phase 2: Documentation parsing and initial tool generation complete."** âœ… COMPLETED

### Phase 3: MCP Server Implementation âœ… COMPLETED

**Goal:** Implement the core `fastmcp` server and integrate the dynamically generated tools.

- **Task 3.1: Create `src/main.py` for the `fastmcp` server.** âœ… COMPLETED
  - Implemented comprehensive MCP server with OpenAPI integration.
- **Task 3.2: Import and register the dynamically generated tools.** âœ… COMPLETED
  - Tools are automatically registered via FastMCP's OpenAPI integration.
- **Task 3.3: Implement `fastmcp` server setup.** âœ… COMPLETED
  - Configured FastMCP with proper authentication (Bearer token).
  - Set up custom route mappings for better organization.
  - Implemented schema validation and fixing.
- **Task 3.4: Add a placeholder for a simple test endpoint.** âœ… COMPLETED
  - Created `test_server.py` for validation instead of placeholder endpoint.
- **Task 3.5: Commit: "Phase 3: MCP server implementation complete."** âœ… COMPLETED

### Phase 4: Refinement and Documentation âœ… COMPLETED

**Goal:** Review the implementation, refine the code, and provide comprehensive documentation for setup, usage, and maintenance.

- **Task 4.1: Review and refine generated tools and server code.** âœ… COMPLETED
  - Implemented proper error handling and schema validation.
  - Added comprehensive logging and debugging support.
  - Created test validation script.
- **Task 4.2: Update `README.md` with comprehensive details.** âœ… COMPLETED
  - Created comprehensive documentation covering:
    - Installation and setup instructions
    - Configuration with environment variables
    - Architecture and how it works
    - Complete API coverage overview
    - Testing and troubleshooting guides
    - Security and performance considerations
- **Task 4.3: Final commit: "Phase 4: Refinement and documentation complete."** âœ… COMPLETED

## ðŸŽ‰ PROJECT COMPLETION SUMMARY

### âœ… What Was Accomplished

1. **Modern FastMCP Integration**: Used FastMCP's native OpenAPI support instead of custom tool generation
2. **Complete API Coverage**: Successfully integrated all 32 GoHighLevel API modules (223+ endpoints)
3. **Robust Schema Handling**: Implemented automatic fixing of GoHighLevel's non-standard OpenAPI schemas
4. **Production-Ready Server**: Created a fully functional MCP server with proper authentication and error handling
5. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Provided detailed setup, configuration, and usage documentation
6. **Testing Framework**: Created validation scripts to ensure proper server operation

### ðŸš€ Key Improvements Over Original Plan
